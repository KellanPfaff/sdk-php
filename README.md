MemberSuite SDK for PHP
=======

All included examples incorporate the PHPSecLib (https://github.com/phpseclib/phpseclib) so the appropriate version should be downloaded based on the targeted PHP version and installed according to the code specifications.

NOTE: The SDK has been tested for compatibility up to PHP 8.2.x.  If any problems are encountered, please connect with our team at support@membersuite.com

The project is solely for the purpose of performing compatibility checks using the PHPCompatibility (https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility) and PHPCompatibilityWP (https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibilityWP).
